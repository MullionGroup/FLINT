# Visual Studio Code Remote - Containers ([link](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers))

This vscode folder is for using moja.flint from another library.

For example, moja.mulliongroup is open in visual studio code (remote) and has moja.global built in the container from a branch already.

Opening the right devcontainer in moja.mulliongroup will open this folder in vscode attached to the same container.

Hence, allowing us to edit and build moja.global in the container as well
